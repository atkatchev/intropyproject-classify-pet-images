    "# Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "A city is hosting a citywide dog show in need of volunteers to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.\n",

    "\n",
    "The project will shows the use of an already developed Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs.\n",

    "# Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine which image classification algorithm works the \"best\" on classifying images as \"dogs\" or \"not dogs\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine how well the \"best\" classification algorithm works on correctly identifying a dog's breed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The term image classifier is a tool that has an input and an output. The Input is an image. The output determines what the image depicts. (for example: a dog). The fact that image classifiers do not always categorize the images correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Time how long each algorithm takes to solve the classification problem. With computational tasks, there is often a trade-off between accuracy and runtime. The more accurate an algorithm, the higher the likelihood that it will take more time to run and use more computational resources to run.\n",

    "# Important Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this image classification task an image classification application using a deep learning model called a convolutional neural network (often abbreviated as CNN). CNNs work particularly well for detecting features in images like colors, textures, and edges; then using these features to identify objects in the images. A CNN that has already learned the features from a giant dataset of 1.2 million images called [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/). There are different types of CNNs that have different structures (architectures) that work better or worse depending on the specification criteria. Three different architectures (AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet) are explored and determine which has the best performance for the application described.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier function is in classifier.py that will allows a CNNs to classify the images. The test_classifier.py file contains an example program that demonstrates how to use the classifier function. For this project, the focus will be on using Python to complete these tasks using the classifier function."
