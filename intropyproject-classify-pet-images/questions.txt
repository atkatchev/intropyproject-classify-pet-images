1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.
1. The three model architectures classified the breed of the dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed, and it was correct! 

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.
2. Dog_01.jpg was classigied correctly for each of the three architectures, however Dog_02.jpg was not correct

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.
3. VGG classified Animal_Name_01.jog correctly and Object_name_01.jpg correctly, Alexnet and Resnet only classified the Object_name_01.jpg correctly.
